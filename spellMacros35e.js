When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf.atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Augury!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/augury.htm )}} {{School:= Divination}} {{Level:= Cleric 2}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M, F}} {{Casting Time:=1 minute}} {{Range:= Personal }} {{Target:= You }} {{Duration:= Instantaneous}} {{Saving Throw:= n/a}} {{Spell Resist.:= n/a}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal,  dominate person,  or dominate monster,  your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible.Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.The binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an Antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mage's disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal,  banishment,  or a similar effect.In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Blacklight!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/blacklight.htm )}} {{School:= Evocation}} {{Level:= Darkness 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M}} {{Casting Time:=1 action}} {{Range:= Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= 1 round/level (D)}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates or none (object)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes or no (object)}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful! }} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! }} {{notes= The caster creates an area of total darkness.

You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.Blinking has several effects, as follows.Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're Blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.Force effects and abjurations affect you normally.

The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an 'eye' of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit.Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area. A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions. An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center. A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion. A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.Wind Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area.Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder.A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Corrupt Weapon!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/corruptweapon.htm )}} {{School:= Transmutation}} {{Level:= Blackguard 1}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Touch }} {{Target:= Weapon touched }} {{Duration:= 1 min./level}} {{Saving Throw:= None}} {{Spell Resist.:= No}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful! }} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! }} {{notes= This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against good foes.

This swarm forms a living aura around the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own crown of vermin. The swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the crown of vermin bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the crown of vermin. The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren't enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell's effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally.The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell's duration. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from the character's control through any means. The vermin make all saving throws to avoid damaging effects using the character's base saving throw bonuses. They gain the character's spell resistance, if any, and they get saving throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay vermin. A character can see through his or her crown of vermin without difficulty, but gains one-half concealment against enemy attacks launched both outside and within the character's crown of vermin. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Crushing Despair!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/crushingdespair.htm )}} {{School:= Enchantment}} {{Level:= Bard 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 4}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= 30 ft. }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= 1 min./level}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

Cancels magical spells and effects.}} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! Cancels magical spells and effects.}} {{notes= You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.Area Dispel: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Displacement!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/displacement.htm )}} {{School:= Illusion}} {{Level:= Bard 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3}} {{Cmpnts:=V, M}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Touch }} {{Target:= Creature touched }} {{Duration:= 1 round/level (D)}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates (harmless)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes (harmless)}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as 'Come here,' 'Go there,' 'Fight,' and 'Stand still.' You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Doom!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/doom.htm )}} {{School:= Necromancy}} {{Level:= Cleric 1}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, DF}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) }} {{Target:= One living creature }} {{Duration:= 1 min./level}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

Any creatures touched by the character when Dreamscape is cast also make the transition to the borders of unconscious thought. They may opt to follow the character, wander off into the dreams of others, or stumble back into the waking world (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by the character). Creatures unwilling to accompany the character into the region of dreams receive a Will save, negating the effect if successful. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Dweomer of Transference!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/dweomeroftransference.htm )}} {{School:= Evocation}} {{Level:= Cleric 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S}} {{Casting Time:=1 minute}} {{Range:= Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) }} {{Target:= One willing psionic creature }} {{Duration:= 1 round/level}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates (harmless)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes (harmless)}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.Cave,  Cavern,  or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).River,  Lake,  or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.Pinned beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Eclipse!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/eclipse.htm )}} {{School:= Conjuration}} {{Level:= Not specified}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, XP}} {{Casting Time:=10 minutes}} {{Range:= 200 miles }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= Up to 8 hours (D)}} {{Saving Throw:= None}} {{Spell Resist.:= No}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful! }} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! }} {{notes= With this spell, the character can create a limited eclipse, as though a heavenly body moves between the sun and the earth.

No matter how many negative levels the character bestows on him or her self, the eidolon can never have more character levels than the character has (taking the negative levels into account). Treat the duplicate as the character with a number of negative levels conferred that would lower him or her to the character level of the eidolon. The eidolon is considered fresh and rested when created. It may cast any spell the character has access to, including an epic spell. Use the eidolon's Spellcraft modifier as the basis for the number of epic spells it can cast in a day, and its effective character level as a basis for its skills, feats, and other abilities. The eidolon is effectively lower level than the character and probably can't cast all the spells he or she knows. A powerful enough eidolon might conceivably cast the eidolon spell itself. The eidolon appears in whatever mundane clothing the character desires when initially conjured, but it has no other possessions. It shares part of the character's soul, so it is the character for all intents and purposes. The character and his or her eidolon communicate with each other normally. Usually, the eidolon does not begrudge its brief existence, because it is still part of the character. If the eidolon is killed prior to the expiration of the spell's duration, the character immediately regains the lost levels.

Connects two planes for travel or summoning.}} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! Connects two planes for travel or summoning.}} {{notes= Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate.The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate,  although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in 'livestock' rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Gathering of Maggots!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/gatheringofmaggots.htm )}} {{School:= Conjuration}} {{Level:= Not specified}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, DF}} {{Casting Time:=7 days}} {{Range:= n/a }} {{Target:= Dead creature touched }} {{Duration:= Permanent}} {{Saving Throw:= Fortitude negates (harmless)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes (harmless)}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful! }} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! }} {{notes= When this spell is cast, worms or maggots slither and crawl their way inexorably toward the corpse touched.

Inscription harms those who pass it.}} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! Inscription harms those who pass it.}} {{notes= This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead, polymorph, and nondetection (and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).Note: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding.Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.Blast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.Spell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Goodberry!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/goodberry.htm )}} {{School:= Transmutation}} {{Level:= Druid 1}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, DF}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Touch }} {{Target:= 2d4 fresh berries touched }} {{Duration:= One day/level}} {{Saving Throw:= None}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful! 2d4 berries each cure 1 hp (max 8 hp/24 hours).}} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! 2d4 berries each cure 1 hp (max 8 hp/24 hours).}} {{notes= Casting goodberry upon a handful of freshly picked berries makes 2d4 of them magical.

The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.

When the character casts the spell, a stroke of energy deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to each creature within the spell's area. Living lightning follows all the standard rules for epic spell casting when the character casts it. Living lightning is sentient and generally friendly toward the character. It has the character's mental ability scores, but it has no physical ability scores. It senses the world through the character's senses and communicates with him or her by thought. As a self-triggering spell, it isn't truly alive but is a fragment of the character's personality. It cares little for the world around it, but at the character's urging (and sometimes at its own discretion) it casts itself at his or her foes. Casters who prepare spells before casting must prepare Living lightning normally in order for it to cast itself. When the spell casts itself, it acts on the character's initiative but does not count against his or her own actions in the round. The character cannot simultaneously cast Living lightning while it is casting its own effect, even if it has been prepared more than once. Living lightning uses up one of the character's epic spell slots for the day whenever it casts itself. When the character has used up all his or her epic spell slots for the day (or has cast all his or her prepared Living lightning spells, if a caster who must prepare spells), Living lightning becomes quiescent. It remains so until the character has rested to regain his or her epic spell slots for the next day. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Locate Creature!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/locatecreature.htm )}} {{School:= Divination}} {{Level:= Bard 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level) }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= 10 min./level}} {{Saving Throw:= None}} {{Spell Resist.:= No}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Mage's Private Sanctum!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/mage'sprivatesanctum.htm )}} {{School:= Abjuration}} {{Level:= Sorcerer/Wizard 5}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M}} {{Casting Time:=10 minutes}} {{Range:= Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= 24 hours (D)}} {{Saving Throw:= None}} {{Spell Resist.:= No}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Int bonus or your Cha bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19-20 and a critical multiplier of x2.The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers.Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target.

The sword's AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time Mage's sword strikes it.

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding,  planar binding,  and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection,  blink,  dimension door,  etherealness,  gate,  plane shift,  shadow walk,  teleport,  and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle,  but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Magic Circle Against Good!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magiccircleagainstgood.htm )}} {{School:= Abjuration}} {{Level:= Cleric 3, Evil 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M/DF}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Touch }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= 10 min./level}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates (harmless)}} {{Spell Resist.:= No; see text}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.While in the magic jar,  you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar,  and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar,  if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar,  you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or at the host's location. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Magic Missile!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicmissile.htm )}} {{School:= Evocation}} {{Level:= Sorcerer/Wizard 1}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) }} {{Target:= Up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart }} {{Duration:= Instantaneous}} {{Saving Throw:= None}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful! 1d4+1 damage; +1 missile per two levels above 1st (max 5).}} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! 1d4+1 damage; +1 missile per two levels above 1st (max 5).}} {{notes= A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment.

The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, Magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A Magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a Magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Magic Stone!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicstone.htm )}} {{School:= Transmutation}} {{Level:= Cleric 1, Druid 1, Earth 1}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, DF}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Touch }} {{Target:= Up to three pebbles touched }} {{Duration:= 30 minutes or until discharged}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates (harmless, object)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes (harmless, object)}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Planar Ally!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/planarally.htm )}} {{School:= Conjuration}} {{Level:= Cleric 6}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, DF, XP}} {{Casting Time:=10 minutes}} {{Range:= Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= Instantaneous}} {{Saving Throw:= None}} {{Spell Resist.:= No}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

Traps extraplanar creature of 6 HD or less until it performs a task.}} {{notes= Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil) to make the trap more secure.If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete.  When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can't be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell.

If the caster moves him or herself, or the subject, into a slower time stream for 5 rounds, time ceases to flow for the subject, and its condition becomes fixed-no force or effect can harm it until the duration expires. If the caster moves him or her self into a faster time stream, the caster speeds up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time. Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still harm the caster. While the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are invulnerable to his or her attacks and spells; however, the caster can create spell effects and leave them to take effect when he or she reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of time, epic spells used to transport a subject into a faster time stream cannot be made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be extended. More simply, the seed can haste or slow a subject for 20 rounds by transporting it to the appropriate time stream. This decreases the Spellcraft DC by -4. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Seed: Ward!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/seed:ward.htm )}} {{School:= Abjuration}} {{Level:= Not specified}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S}} {{Casting Time:=1 minute}} {{Range:= Touch }} {{Target:= Touched creature or object of 2,000 lb. or less; or 10-ft. -radius spherical emanation, centered on you }} {{Duration:= 24 hours}} {{Saving Throw:= None}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful! }} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! }} {{notes= This seed can grant a creature protection from damage of a specified type. The caster can protect a creature from standard damage or from energy damage. The caster can protect a creature or area from magic. Alternatively, he or she can hedge out a type of creature from a specified area. A ward against standard damage protects a creature from whichever two the caster selects of the three damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For a ward against all three types, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Each round, the spell created with the Ward seed absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take, regardless of whether the source of the damage is natural or magical. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.A ward against energy grants a creature protection from whichever one the caster selects of the five energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take from the specified energy type, regardless of whether the source of damage is natural or magical. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1.A ward against a specific type of creature prevents bodily contact from whichever one of several monster types the caster selects. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or intentionally moves within 5 feet of the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.A ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere (with radius 10 feet) that surrounds the caster and excludes all spell effects of up to 1st level. Alternatively, the caster can ward just the target and not create the radius effect. For each additional level of spells to be excluded, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20 (but see below). The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the ward, and such spells fail to affect any target within the ward. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to the protected area without penalty (unless the spell specifically targets a creature and does not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell. Epic spells using the Dispel seed may bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check. The ward may also be brought down with a targeted epic spell using the Destroy seed if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check.Instead of creating an epic spell that uses the Ward seed to nullify all spells of a given level and lower, the caster can create a ward that nullifies a specific spell (or specific set of spells). For each specific spell so nullified, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2 per spell level above 1st. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Seeming!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/seeming.htm )}} {{School:= Illusion}} {{Level:= Bard 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) }} {{Target:= One creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart }} {{Duration:= 12 hours (D)}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates or Will disbelief (if interacted with)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes or No; see text}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise.

You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.

If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment.

Triggered rune slays nearby creatures.}} {{failcheck=Concentration check failed! Triggered rune slays nearby creatures.}} {{notes= This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed.In this case, 'reading' the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death,  but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.Read magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.Note: Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Symbol of Fear!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/symboloffear.htm )}} {{School:= Necromancy}} {{Level:= Cleric 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 6}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M}} {{Casting Time:=10 minutes}} {{Range:= 0 ft.; see text }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= See text}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

Moves object, attacks creature, or hurls object or creature.}} {{notes= You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.Sustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.Combat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points). }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Telekinetic Sphere!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/telekineticsphere.htm )}} {{School:= Evocation}} {{Level:= Sorcerer/Wizard 8}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= 1 min./level (D)}} {{Saving Throw:= Reflex negates (object)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes (object)}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.Familiarity: 'Very familiar' is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. 'Studied carefully' is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. 'Seen casually' is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. 'Viewed once' is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.'False destination' is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.On Target: You appear where you want to be.Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomlySimilar Area: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten 'scrambled.' You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.

Because the chracter's future duplicate is also the character, the character misses the next round as well. He or she simply isn't there. Tampering with the time stream is a tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary.Round One: The character casts time duplicate, the future self from round two arrives, and both act normally.Round Two: The future self-the character-gets snatched back in time to help the past self. During this round, there are no versions of the character present.Round Three: The character rejoins the time stream. The character arrives in the same location and condition that the future self ended with at the end of the first round. Any resources (spells, damage, staff charges) the future self used up in round one are gone for real. Record them now. Using this spell to snatch a single future self stretches time and probability to its limit; more powerful versions of time duplicate are not possible. A character cannot bring more than a single future version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character snatch a version of him or her from farther in the future. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Time Stop!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/timestop.htm )}} {{School:= Transmutation}} {{Level:= Sorcerer/Wizard 9, Trickery 9}} {{Cmpnts:=V}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Personal }} {{Target:= You }} {{Duration:= 1d4+1 rounds (apparent time); see text}} {{Saving Throw:= n/a}} {{Spell Resist.:= n/a}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object.

You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5- foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Wall of Stone!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/wallofstone.htm )}} {{School:= Conjuration}} {{Level:= Cleric 5, Druid 6, Earth 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, M/DF}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) }} {{Target:= n/a }} {{Duration:= Instantaneous}} {{Saving Throw:= See text}} {{Spell Resist.:= No}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.Unlike a wall of iron,  you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.

Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants. }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Warp Wood!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/warpwood.htm )}} {{School:= Transmutation}} {{Level:= Druid 2}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) }} {{Target:= 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius }} {{Duration:= Instantaneous}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates (object)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes (object)}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!

Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won't cause you to become entangled.Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs.

Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you. Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school. Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.

Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item. Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five Wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies. Remove injuries and afflictions. A single Wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A Wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead. Revive the dead. A Wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A Wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes,  one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A Wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level. Transport travelers. A Wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. Undo misfortune. A Wish can undo a single recent event. The Wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.You may try to use a Wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The Wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells). }}&{template:DnD35StdRoll} {{spellflag=true}} {{name=@{character_name} }} {{subtags=casts [Wood Shape!](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/woodshape.htm )}} {{School:= Transmutation}} {{Level:= Druid 2}} {{Cmpnts:=V, S, DF}} {{Casting Time:=1 standard action}} {{Range:= Touch }} {{Target:= One touched piece of wood no larger than 10 cu. ft. + 1 cu. ft./level }} {{Duration:= Instantaneous}} {{Saving Throw:= Will negates (object)}} {{Spell Resist.:= Yes (object)}} {{Caster level check: = [[ 1d20+@{casterlevel2}+@{spellpen} ]] vs spell resistance.}} {{compcheck= Conc: [[ {1d20 + [[ @{concentration} ]] }>?{Concentration DC=15+Spell Level or 10+Damage Received|16} ]] }} {{succeedcheck=Concentration check successful!
